# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
Using charity dataset and neural networks to build a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by the client.

### Purpose of the Analysis
Explain the purpose of this analysis. Write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for AlphabetSoup.

## Results
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following:
### Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features of your model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a difference model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
